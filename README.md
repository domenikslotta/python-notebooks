# python-notebooks
A collection of notebooks that I created as part of my work as SHK at the University of Paderborn.

## How to use these notebooks

1. Clone this repository and change to new directory

```
$ git clone git@github.com:domenikslotta/python-notebooks.git
$ cd python-notebooks
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment by running the following command-line:

```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source ./env/bin/activate
```

3. To install requirements using pip, run the following command-line:

```
$ pip install -r requrements.txt
```

Now you should be able to start the jupyter server with:

```
$ jupyter-notebook
```

or jump rigth into one of the notebooks, e.g. 

```
$ jupyter-notebook Linearisierung_f√ºr_Gleichgewichte.ipynb
```
